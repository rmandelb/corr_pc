Due to some compiler mismatches, the code sometimes doesnot compile on vera. 

The recommended method for installation is to make a conda environment, 
download g++ compilers and then compile the code using those. 

# create new conda environment and activate it

conda create --name corr_pc
conda activate corr_pc

#install gxx package
conda install conda install -y gxx_linux-64

#compile corr_pc
make
